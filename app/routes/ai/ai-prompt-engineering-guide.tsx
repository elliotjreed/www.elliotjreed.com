        <h3>What is "Prompt Engineering"?</h3>
        <p>
          "<strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>" is the practice of crafting instructions (prompts) to guide generative
          AI models towards producing the desired output.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>What makes a good prompt?</h3>
        <p>
          A good prompt will be clear and concise. It will provide relevant background <strong>context</strong>,
          describe the <strong>action</strong> you want it to take, state the <strong>format</strong> you want the
          response to be in, and will often contain <strong>examples</strong> or references.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my favourite quotes was from Anthropic's{" "}
          <a href="https://askell.io/?utm_source=www.elliotjreed.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
            Amanda Askell
          </a>
          . Here's a rough paraphrasing of what she said:
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9aRN5JkmL8&utm_source=www.elliotjreed.com">
          Imagine you've hired a temporary worker for a task.
          <br />
          They're skilled and knowledgeable about your industry, but they've just arrived and know nothing about your
          specific situation.
          <br />
          They ask, "I'm here to help - what would you like me to do?"
          <br />
          What instructions would you give this person to get the job done correctly?
        </blockquote>

      <section>
        <h3>What is a useful prompt structure?</h3>
        <p>
          To help remember this we can use the mnemonic "<strong>CAFE</strong>":
          <br />
          <a href="#context">Context</a>
          <br />
          <a href="#action">Action</a>
          <br />
          <a href="#format">Format</a>
          <br />
          <a href="#examples">Examples</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, once you have a response you can <a href="#iterate">iterate on the output</a> with the AI Assistant.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>CAFE Framework</h2>
        <p>
          Let's go through each of the elements of the CAFE framework. The order of the elements doesn't matter. The
          important things are <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>simplicity</strong>: prompts should be clear and
          concise, using normal, natural language and sticking to relevant information.
        </p>

        <section id="context">
          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>Provide background information relevant to the action you want to AI Assistant to perform.</p>

          <p>
            This could include context such as the intended audience, your skills, where you are located, or what
            equipment you have access to.
          </p>

          <p>Let's have a look at a bad example of a prompt without context, then a better one with context.</p>

            <h4>Provide positive criteria over negative constraints</h4>
            <p>
              As a general rule, tell the AI Assistant what to do rather than what not to do. That is to say, focus on{" "}
              <strong>positive criteria rather than negative constraints</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a positive criteria could be "<em>use vegan-friendly, plant-based ingredients</em>", whereas
              a negative constraint could be "<em>do not use meat, fish, eggs, or dairy</em>".
            </p>
            <p>
              For another example, a positive criteria could be "
              <em>be concise and use clear section headings and subheadings for easy referencing</em>", as opposed to
              negative constraints such as "<em>do not use long sentences and large blocks of text</em>".

            <h4>Book recommendation prompt</h4>
            <p>For another example, here's a prompt I used recently to find new books to read before sleep.</p>

            <p className="px-4 border-s-4 border-gray-200  dark:border-gray-700 italic">
              I'm looking for some book recommendations, in particular ones which I can read before going to bed.
              <br />
              For this I would prefer shorter novels, or short stories.
              <br />I particularly enjoy books which make me think a bit about deeper subjects like philosophy,
              politics, ethics, religion, culture, and the societal impacts of future technology.
              <br />
              Recently I have enjoyed Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Paper Menagerie collection of short stories by Ken
              Lui as bedtime reads. Other books I have enjoyed, though not for bedtime reading, have been the Dune
              novels, Project Hail Mary, Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky, The Handmaid's Tale and The Testaments
              by Margaret Atwood, the Three Body Problem trilogy. Provide me with 10 book suggestions, each with a one
              line description of why you think the suggestion fits.

            Once you have entered your initial prompt and received a response, evaluate it to see if the response meets
            your requirements. Hopefully your initial prompt will be good enough that you can follow up, if not then
            some re-writing of the prompt might be required.
          </p>

            <h4>Following up</h4>
            <p>
              If the response is close to meeting your requirements, you can discuss the response with the AI Assistant.
              This might be requesting a change, clarifying what you meant, or asking for further information.

                That plan looks good in general, however one of the guests has a severe allergy to tomatoes. Can you
                update the menu to account for that?
                <br />

              of the following techniques:

              <li>
                break the prompt down into smaller tasks, following up with each smaller task after the first response
                from the AI Assistant
              </li>
              <li>changing to an analogous or synonymous task by rephrasing in a different context</li>

                  That looks good, however some of those ingredients will be difficult to find. Can you update the menu
                  to include ingredients easily available from standard British supermarkets, such as Tesco and ASDA?

                  I would like you to take on the role of a diligent and respectful dinner party host who is hosting a
                  Saturday evening dinner party for 12 people. In this role you would want to spend as much time in the
                  company of the guests, and prepare food suitable for all.
                  <br />
                  The food should use ingredients easily available in the United Kingdom, and be suitable for vegans.
                  <br />
                  The menu should be concise and easy to reference, making use of clear sections headed by the time the
                  different elements need attention.
                  <br />
                  Past successful dinner parties included on the menu: a dish based around crispy sesame tofu with a
                  peanut sauce; and a red wine mushroom bourguignon.
